   <p>To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day</p>
   <p>Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say</p>
   <p>No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip</p>
   <p>The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip</p>
   <p>Big iron on his hip</p>
   <p>It was early in the morning when he rode into the town</p>
   <p>He came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around</p>
   <p>"He's an outlaw loose and runnin'", came a whisper from each lip</p>
   <p>"And he's here to do some business with a big iron on his hip</p>
   <p>Big iron on his hip"</p>
   <p>In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red</p>
   <p>Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead</p>
   <p>He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty four</p>
   <p>And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more</p>
