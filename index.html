   <p>To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day</p>
   <p>Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say</p>
   <p>No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip</p>
   <p>The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip</p>
   <p>Big iron on his hip</p>
   <p>It was early in the morning when he rode into the town</p>
   <p>He came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around</p>
   <p>"He's an outlaw loose and runnin'", came a whisper from each lip</p>
   <p>"And he's here to do some business with a big iron on his hip</p>
   <p>Big iron on his hip"</p>
   <p>In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red</p>
   <p>Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead</p>
   <p>He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty four</p>
   <p>And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more</p>
   <p>One and nineteen more</p>
   <p>Now the stranger started talkin' made it plain to folks around</p>
   <p>Was an Arizonia ranger, wouldn't be too long in town</p>
   <p>He was here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead</p>
   <p>And he said it didn't matter that he was after Texas Red</p>
   <p>After Texas Red</p>
   <p>Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red</p>
   <p>But the outlaw didn't worry, men who tried before were dead</p>
   <p>Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip</p>
   <p>Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip</p>
   <p>Big iron on his hip</p>
   <p>Now the morning passed so quickly and it was time for them to meet</p>
   <p>It was twenty past eleven when they rode out in the street</p>
   <p>Folks were watchin' from their windows</p>
   <p>Every body held their breath</p>
   <p>They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death</p>
   <p>About to meet his death</p>
   <p>There was twenty feet between them</p>
   <p>When they stopped to make their play</p>
   <p>And the swiftness of the Ranger still talked about today</p>
   <p>Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
   <p>And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip</p>
   <p>Big iron on his hip</p>
   <p>It was over in a moment and the crowd all gathered 'round</p>
   <p>There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground</p>
   <p>Oh, he might have went on livin' but he made one fatal slip</p>
   <p>When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip</p>
   <p>Big iron on his hip</p>
   <p>Big iron, big iron</p>
   <p>Oh he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip</p>
   <p>Big iron on his hip</p>
